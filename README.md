This MATLAB program generates the full .repz file needed for structured illumination microscopy (SIM), for use in MetroCon & SIMToolbox. This program assumes you want: patterns with straight lines, evenly spaced angles, pattern step size of 1 pixel, always include the 0 degree angle, & 2 millisecond sequence timing (including the location of the "48455 2ms 1-bit Balanced.seq3" file).
